Hi there, my name is Arshdeep and this was my assignment on MVC web development , we were given a task to make a website about a specific product 
that was given to us in the class.
Under This assignment I made a perfectly working website using .NET Core and linked the website to the DataBase.
Where you can find the different Product list and can Edit and Add new inventory.
I also implied Css to the webpages to make them look more apealing.
